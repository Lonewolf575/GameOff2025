# Space Lighthouse GDD

# Game Concept

You are an operator of a \[space lighthouse\] in charge of ensuring safe passage of various ships in and out of your colony by using the tools at your disposal to assess threats, negotiate with crew, and keep your colony safe.

## Inspiration

* Papers Please  
* Radio operators

# Story

You are part of a team who has recently been tasked with reviving an old space colony that had mysteriously went dark. With no obvious signs of struggle, you take up your post as the colony’s \[space lighthouse operator\] with the responsibility to hail incoming ships, assess them for threats, and ensure they get to the colony safely or are mitigated.

*This is basically you, sitting in front of your various instruments*

As you work, it becomes more clear that this colony is not in the safest part of the galaxy as all manner of hostile craft are attempting to sneak their way in and cause the colony harm from nature phenomenon to space pirates, and even life forms as of yet unseen.

Through this process, you slowly start to piece together what happened to the original colony and realize that coming back may not have been the best idea…

# Main Gameplay Loop

1. ## Identify some entity via your instruments

At first, you will be relying on your radar scanner to identify incoming craft. Your radar tells you that there is something within your range of your instruments, but does not provide any more details than position.

2. ## Hail the entity to ascertain its whereabouts

The player will radio the ship asking for identification, likely a call sign, and use their \[call sign dictionary\] to cross reference the ship in the ship manifest. Not all ships will have call signs and not all ships will respond. This is where a number of dialog options will be presented and the player will have to use their wits to try and deduce what their next move is. The other ship may be lying to try and dock into the space port and raid the colony, or maybe they don’t answer at all because they are a meteor or maybe they are a ship that just got away from a battle but their comms are down.

3. ## Send a drone out to get more details

The player has access to a drone that can carry a limited number of instruments that can be used to get more information about the craft that approaches. The drones take time to go out, encounter the entity and perform their scan which means they only get one shot to determine if the entity is good or bad. The player has to act on imperfect knowledge of the situation to make a call.

4. ## Decide on the entity’s fate

At this point, the entity is about to cross the point of no return. A decision needs to be made otherwise there will be nothing to stop the entity from docking. This is where the player can decide to do things like:

* Grant the ship passage  
* Intercept craft with anti-ship missiles  
* Intercept object with anti-asteroid lasers  
* Turn ship away  
* Send out life preserver

5. ## Results

Depending on the reaction to the situation, different things can happen. Each entity has a “goal” of making it past your threshold, so once they make it past there, that’s when something happens. Some examples based on the various entities:

* Cargo ships \- deliver supplies  
* Space pirate ships \- lose supplies  
* Asteroids \- lose supplies and people  
* Commercial ships \- gain people  
* Military ships \- upgrade resources  
* Research vessels \-  upgrade resources  
* Aliens \- supplies and lore?

# Player Resources

The player’s ultimate goal is to maintain the colony’s health. There are several different resources to help with this:

* Population  
  * Essentially hit points. If the colony’s population reaches zero, then the player has lost  
  * Population can slowly grow back over time  
  * Population can be increased by various entities docking at colony  
    * Cruise ships for example  
* Supplies  
  * Influences how big the population can be (max health)  
  * If there are not enough supplies for the colonists, they will start to perish (lose health)  
  * Supplies drain at a rate proportional to the number of colonists?  
    * This is just an idea, but the larger a population is, the more resources it consumes.   
    * Alternatively, these just drain at a constant rate  
  * Supplies are somewhat analogous to a shield that is constantly depleting  
  * Increased by various entities:  
    * Cargo ships  
* Research materials  
  * Used for upgrading your drones or sensors  
  * Relatively rare  
    * Feeds into the sense of progression  
  * Obtained through various entities  
    * Military vessels  
    * Research vessels

# Player Tools

## Radar

Used for detecting the presence of entities in space. Screen consists of a rotating bar that bleeps when passing over and entity and causes the entity to display a visual on the screen.

*Typical radar screen*

Upgrades:  
	Level 1: Shows position of entities. Updates every 5 seconds  
	Level 2: Shows shape of entities. Updates every 4 seconds  
	Level 3: Shows direction? Updates every 3 seconds

## Radio

Used to hail ships and communicate with passengers. Allows the user to access dialog options for entities. Does not have upgrade paths

## Documentation access

Used to cross reference information the entities are giving you to confirm if they are who they say they are. Contains:

* Call sign log \- used to identify which call signs should be on which ships  
* Ship manifests \- used to know how many people are supposed to be on a given ship  
* Ship classifications \- used to know what characteristics certain classes of ships should have

## Upgrade Station

## Drone with Scanners

### X-Ray

### Radiation

### Infrared

# Win/Lose Conditions

## Player Win

The player wins the game after they have successfully learned about what happened to the original colony by interacting with the \[insert reason here\]. This happens after some number of entities have appeared.

## Player Loss

The player loses if the colony population ever reaches zero, indicating the colony met the same fate as the previous one. However, because of your influence on the “crime scene”, no one will ever know what truly happened to the original colony.

# Status Effects

Some entities might carry sicknesses or boons that could affect the population. These can add levels of stress to the player and force them to reprioritize.

# Entities

## Cargo ship

## Space Pirates

## Research Vessels

## Cruise Ships

## Unmanned craft (robots/AI)

## Asteroids

## Military Vessels

## Aliens

## Space Whale
